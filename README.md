# NanoporeLong5
Script takes Fastq file and POD5 (all reads in fastq need to be in POD5 data), combinning the data from both, and creates a long5 file with signal, dwell time, nucleotides, phred score, PolyA classification.  The data format is such that each point of signal from the nanopore is a diffrent row, in pA units.
